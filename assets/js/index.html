            Dr. Norman Borlaug, third from the left, trains biologists in Mexico
            on how to increase wheat yields - part of his life-long war on
            hunger.

                program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different
                strains of disease resistent wheat - including different

                crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been
                genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
                before we called it science, people were selecting the best
                breeds."
